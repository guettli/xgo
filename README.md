# xgo
Enable function Trap for `go`, and provide tools like Mock and Trace to help go developers write unit test and debug both easier and faster.

`xgo` works as a drop-in replacement for `go run`,`go build`, and `go test`.

It adds missing abilities to go program by cooperating with (or hacking) the go compiler.

Theses abilities include [Mock](#mock), [Trap](#trap) and [Trace](#trace).

See [Usage](#usage) and [Documentation](#xgo) for more details. 


# Installation
```sh
# macOS and Linux
curl -fsSL https://github.com/xhd2015/xgo/raw/master/install.sh | bash
```

If you've already installed `xgo`, you can upgrade it with:

```sh
xgo upgrade
```

# Requirement
`xgo` requires at least `go1.17` to compile.

There is no specific limitation on OS and Architecture. 

**All OS and Architectures** are supported by `xgo` as long as they are supported by `go`.

# Usage
The following code demonstrates how to setup mock on a given function:
- The function `add(a,b)` normally adds `a` and `b` up, resulting in `a+b`,
- However, after `mock.AddFuncInterceptor`, the logic is changed to `a-b`.

(check [test/testdata/mock_res/main.go](test/testdata/mock_res/main.go) for more details.)
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/xhd2015/xgo/runtime/core"
    "github.com/xhd2015/xgo/runtime/mock"
)

func main() {
    before := add(5, 2)
    fmt.Printf("before mock: add(5,2)=%d\n", before)
    mock.AddFuncInterceptor(add, func(ctx context.Context, fn *core.FuncInfo, args core.Object, results core.Object) error {
        a := args.GetField("a").Value().(int)
        b := args.GetField("b").Value().(int)
        res := a - b
        results.GetFieldIndex(0).Set(res)
        return nil
    })
    after := add(5, 2)
    fmt.Printf("after mock: add(5,2)=%d\n", after)
}

func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

```

Run with `go`:

```sh
go run ./
# output:
#  before mock: add(5,2)=7
#  after mock: add(5,2)=7
```

Run with `xgo`:

```sh
xgo run ./
# output:
#  before mock: add(5,2)=7
#  after mock: add(5,2)=3
```

# Trap
Trap allows developer to intercept function execution on the fly.

Trap is the core of `xgo` as it is the basis of other abilities like Mock and Trace.

The following example logs function execution trace by adding a Trap interceptor:

(check [test/testdata/trap/trap.go](test/testdata/trap/trap.go) for more details.)
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/xhd2015/xgo/runtime/core"
    "github.com/xhd2015/xgo/runtime/trap"
)

func init() {
    trap.AddInterceptor(&trap.Interceptor{
        Pre: func(ctx context.Context, f *core.FuncInfo, args core.Object, results core.Object) (interface{}, error) {
            trap.Skip()
            if f.Name == "A" {
                fmt.Printf("trap A\n")
                return nil, nil
            }
            if f.Name == "B" {
                fmt.Printf("abort B\n")
                return nil, trap.ErrAbort
            }
            return nil, nil
        },
    })
}

func main() {
    A()
    B()
}

func A() {
    fmt.Printf("A\n")
}

func B() {
    fmt.Printf("B\n")
}
```

Run with `go`:

```sh
go run ./
# output:
#   A
#   B
```

Run with `xgo`:

```sh
xgo run ./
# output:
#   trap A
#   A
#   abort B
```

`AddInterceptor()` add given interceptor to either global or local, depending on whether it is called from `init` or after `init`:
- Before `init`: effective globally for all goroutines,
- After `init`: effective only for current goroutine, and will be cleared after current goroutine exits.

When `AddInterceptor()` is called after `init`, it will return a dispose function to clear the interceptor earlier before current goroutine exits.

Example:

```go
func main(){
    clear := trap.AddInterceptor(...)
    defer clear()
    ...
}
```

# Mock
Mock simplifies the process of setting up Trap interceptors.

It exposes 1 API:
- `AddFuncInterceptor()`

The detailed usage can be found in [Usage](#usage) section.

# Trace
It is painful when debugging with a deep call stack.

Trace addresses this issue by collecting the hiearchical stack trace and stores it into file for later use. 

Needless to say, with Trace, debug becomes less usual:

(check [test/testdata/trace/trace.go](test/testdata/trace/trace.go) for more details.)
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/xhd2015/xgo/runtime/trace"
)

func init() {
    trace.Enable()
}

func main() {
    A()
    B()
    C()
}
func A() { fmt.Printf("A\n") }
func B() { fmt.Printf("B\n");C(); }
func C() { fmt.Printf("C\n") }
```

Run with `go`:

```sh
go run ./
# output:
#   A
#   B
#   C
#   C
```

Run with `xgo`:

```sh
XGO_TRACE_OUTPUT=stdout xgo run ./
# output a JSON representing the call stacktrace like:
#        {
#            "Name": "main",
#            "Children": [{
#                 "Name": "A"
#                },{
#                  "Name": "B",
#                  "Children": [{
#                       "Name": "C"
#                   }]
#                },{
#                   "Name": "C"
#                }
#            ]
#        }
#
# NOTE: other fields are ommited for displaying key information.
```

You can view the trace with:`xgo tool trace TestExample.json`

Output:
![trace html](cmd/trace/testdata/stack_trace.jpg "Trace")

By default, Trace will write traces to a temp directory under current working directory. This behavior can be overridden by setting `XGO_TRACE_OUTPUT` to different values:
- `XGO_TRACE_OUTPUT=stdout`: traces will be written to stdout, for debugging purepose,
- `XGO_TRACE_OUTPUT=<dir>`: traces will be written to `<dir>`,
- `XGO_TRACE_OUTPUT=off`: turn off trace.

# Evolution of `xgo`
`xgo` is the successor of the original [go-mock](https://github.com/xhd2015/go-mock), which works by rewriting go code before compile.

The strategy employed by `go-mock` works well but causes much longer build time for larger projects due to source code explosion.

However, `go-mock` is remarkable for it's discovery of Trap, Trace besides Mock, and additional abilities like trapping variable and disabling map randomness.

It is the shoulder which `xgo` stands on.
